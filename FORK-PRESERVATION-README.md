# Fork Preservation - UX Pattern Development

## Purpose
This fork contains experimental UX pattern development work that diverges from the upstream validatedpatterns/layered-zero-trust repository. It is preserved for historical reference and potential future integration.

## Key Features Developed
- **Pattern UX Architecture**: New discovery-driven deployment system
- **5-Stage Deployment**: Comprehensive deployment architecture 
- **Enhanced Logging**: Sequential log numbering and comprehensive monitoring
- **Dynamic Configuration**: YAML-driven component discovery
- **Improved User Experience**: Better status display and error handling

## Major Components Added
- `common/pattern-ux-config.yaml` - UX configuration framework
- `common/pattern-ux-metadata.yaml` - Pattern metadata definitions
- `common/scripts/pattern-ux-lib.sh` - Core UX library functions (2454+ lines)
- `common/scripts/pattern-ux-deploy.sh` - Enhanced deployment script
- `common/scripts/pattern-ux-uninstall.sh` - Enhanced uninstall script
- `common/scripts/deploy-pattern-verbose.sh` - Verbose deployment (787 lines)
- `common/scripts/uninstall-pattern-verbose.sh` - Verbose uninstall (555 lines)
- `NEW-INSTALLATION-METHOD-PROPOSAL.md` - Detailed proposal document

## Development Statistics
- **31 commits** of UX pattern development
- **5,314 lines added** of new functionality
- **69 files changed** with UX enhancements

## Branch Information
- **Main Branch**: `main` - kept in sync with upstream
- **Development Branch**: `my-branch` - contains all UX pattern work
- **Base Commit**: Diverged from upstream at commit `518f8fb`
- **Latest UX Commit**: `95f92cd` - "Fix: Stage 1 discovery functions now working correctly"

## Note
This work represents significant investment in improving the user experience for validated patterns deployment. While not intended for immediate upstream contribution, it contains valuable insights and implementations that may inform future development.

## Repository State
- Upstream tracking properly configured
- Main branch updated to latest upstream (commit `f76fed8`)
- UX development work preserved in `my-branch`
- No plans for upstream contribution of this experimental work
