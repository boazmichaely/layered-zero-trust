back to our project.
We need to change the info about the order of the plan presented upon startup. Also  some of the text as I specify below, while maintaining the table format. Rememebr to implement  text changes in config maps, do not hard code.
You also messed up the order, whereby you are installing argoCD apps before the operators. The argoCS apps should be the very last action, unless you prove me wrong on that. (check dependencies)

Now, I am going to specify a different order than that you are presenting today, so I need to understand where the current order came from.
